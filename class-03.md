## Lists
there are three types of lists
1. Ordered lists
2. Unorderd lists
3. Definition lists

In ordered list and unordered list we need to use a `<li>` tag which stand for *list item* also Each item in the list is placed between a `li` tag.

In definition lists we can use `dl` tag to creat these type of lists 

Note : Lists can be nested inside one another.

## Boxes
We can change the box dimensions using some properties using CSS and here are some examples 
- `width`
    * `min-width`
    * `max-width`
- `height`
    * `min-height`
    * `max-height`

Every box has three available properties that can be adjusted to control its appearance:
1. Padding
2. Borders
3. margins

### borders
we can adjust borders with many properties e.g
1. `border-width`
2. `border-style`
3. `border-color`
or we can write all these spesifications in `border` property

`text-align` used to align the contents to specific side 

## Some CSS3 properties
- border-image
- box-shadow
- border-radius

## TYPE COERCION
type coercion is where JavaScript convert data types behind the scenes to complete an operation.

### strong and weak typing
- strong typing is where you specify what data type each variable will be.
- weak typing is where data type for a variable can change.
Note: Javascript considered as a weak typing

## TRUTHY and FALSY VALUES
Due to type coercion, every value in JavaScript can be treated as if it were true or false.
1. Truthy values
    - traditional true boolean value
    - number other than zero
    - string with contents
    - zero written as a string 
    - false written as a string
2. Falsy values
    - traditional false boolean value
    - number zero
    - NAN
    - empty value
    - A variable with no value assigned to it

## Loops 
examples on loops in javascript
1. for loop
2. while loop
    * do while loop
