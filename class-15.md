## worker today
* A worker today might start the morning by collaborating with a team of engineers,
* send emails to colleagues marketing a new brand,
* jump on a conference call planning an entirely different product line, 
* juggling team meetings with accounting and the party-planning committee.

Our **data-saturated** age enables us to examine our work habits and office quirks with a scrutiny that our cubicle-bound forebears could only dream of.


Note: most valuable firms have come to realize that analyzing and improving individual workers ­— a practice known as ‘‘employee performance optimization’’ — isn’t enough. 

## Group studies
* show that groups tend to innovate faster, see mistakes more quickly and find better solutions to problems
* show that people working in teams tend to achieve better results and report higher job satisfaction.

## Google reasearch
 After looking at over a hundred groups for more than a year, Project Aristotle researchers concluded that understanding and influencing group norms were the keys to improving Google’s teams.

 ## MIT reasearch
 The researchers concluded that what distinguished the ‘‘good’’ teams from the dysfunctional groups was how teammates treated one another. 

## not all the good teams appeared to behave in the same ways. 
 * Some teams had a bunch of smart people who figured out how to break up work evenly,
 * said Anita Woolley, the study’s lead author. 
 * Other groups had pretty average members, but they came up with ways to take advantage of everyone’s relative strengths. 
 * Some groups had one strong leader. 
 * Others were more fluid, and everyone took a leadership role.

 ## all the good teams generally shared. 
 * team members spoke in roughly the same proportion
 * had high ‘‘average social sensitivity’’

 ## Google’s conclusions 
* managers have always known. 
* members listen to one another
* show sensitivity to feelings and needs.
