## Domain Modeling
Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem.
### model
A model describes the various entities, their attributes and behaviors, as well as the constraints that govern the problem domain. 
### object-oriented model
An entity that stores data in properties and encapsulates behaviors in methods. 

### Some tips to follow when building domain models.

1. When modeling a single entity that'll have many instances, build self-contained objects with the same attributes and behaviors.
2. Model its attributes with a constructor function that defines and initializes properties.
3. Model its behaviors with small methods that focus on doing one job well.
4. Create instances using the new keyword followed by a call to a constructor function.
5. Store the newly created object in a variable so you can access its properties and methods from outside.
6. Use the this variable within methods so you can access the object's properties and methods from inside.

## Tables
we can use `<table>` tag to creat table
* `<tr>` to indicate the start of each row 
* `<td>` to represent each cell 
* `<th>` tands for table heading.

## objects
to creat object we can use CONSTRUCTOR SYNTAX `new object()` then we can add properties and methods 

### Arrays
arrays are special type of object

### Built in objects 
* window object
* document object
* string object
* number object
* math object 
* date object
 
#### DATA TYPES
1. number
2. string
3. boolean
4. undefined
5. null 
6. objects
