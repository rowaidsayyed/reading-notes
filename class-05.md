## Images
Adding Images : we can add image using `<img>` tag and we can tell the browser where is the image using src attribute 
also we can specify the size of the image using height and width properties 

### Three Rules for Creating Images
1. Save images in the right format
2. Save images at the right size
3. Use the correct resolution

### Figure and Figure Caption
Images often come with captions so HTML5 has introduced a new `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` elements
Before these elements were created there was noway to associate an `<img>` element with its caption.

## Colors
- The `color` property allows you to specify the color of text inside an element.
- The `background-color` property allows you to specify the color of the background for an element.

### Contrast
* When picking foreground and background colors, it is important to ensure that there is enough contrast for the text to be legible.
### CSS3 properties
* opacity
* HSL Colors    
* HSLA

## Text
The properties that allow you to control the appearance of text can be split into two groups
1. Those that directly affect the font and its appearance
2. Those that would have the same effect on text no matter what font you were using

### Typeface 
When choosing a typeface, it is important to understand that a browser will usually only display it if it's installed on that user's computer
#### Specifying Typefaces
- `font-family`
- `font-size`

Note: programs offer the same sizes of text This is because they are set according to a scale or ratio that was developed by European typographers.

#### Units of Type Size
1. pixels
2. persentages
3. ems

#### useful properties 
- font-weight
- font-style
- text-transform
- text-decoration

#### pseudo-elements
- ` :first-letter `
- ` :first-line `
